    <h1>How to Safely Record Evidence of Domestic Abuse -- A Survivor's Digital Safety Guide</h1>

    <p>If you are experiencing domestic violence, you are not alone. According to the World Health Organization, 1 in 3 women worldwide have experienced physical or sexual violence from an intimate partner. In the United States, the National Domestic Violence Hotline receives over 370,000 calls per year.</p>

    <p>Evidence can change everything. A recording of threats, a photograph of injuries, a saved text message -- these can mean the difference between a protection order being granted or denied, between a case moving forward or being dismissed. But gathering evidence in an abusive situation is dangerous, and it must be done safely.</p>

    <p>This guide was written with input from domestic violence advocates and is designed to help survivors understand how to safely document abuse using digital tools -- with your safety as the absolute first priority.</p>

    <div class="callout callout-danger">
      <strong>Your Safety Comes First -- Always</strong>
      No piece of evidence is worth your life. If gathering evidence would put you in greater danger, do not do it. A domestic violence advocate can help you develop a safety plan that includes evidence preservation strategies appropriate for your specific situation. Call the National DV Hotline at <strong>1-800-799-7233</strong> to speak with a trained advocate 24/7.

    <!-- SECTION 1 -->
    <h2 id="digital-safety">1. Digital Safety First</h2>

    <p>Before you read any further, take a moment to consider your digital safety. Abusers frequently monitor their partners' devices -- checking browser history, reading text messages, tracking app installations, and using spyware. If your device is being monitored, searching for information about domestic violence, legal options, or recording apps could escalate the danger.</p>

    <h3>Immediate Steps to Protect Yourself</h3>

    <div class="step-cards">
      <div class="step-card">
        <h4>Use Private or Incognito Browsing</h4>
        <p>Open a private browsing window (Ctrl+Shift+N in Chrome, Ctrl+Shift+P in Firefox) for any searches related to domestic violence, legal help, or safety planning. Private browsing does not save your browsing history, cookies, or search queries. However, it is not invisible -- your internet service provider and anyone with access to your router may still see the sites you visit.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step-card">
        <h4>Clear Your Browser History</h4>
        <p>If you have already visited DV-related websites in a regular browser window, clear the specific entries from your history. In most browsers: press Ctrl+H to open history, find the relevant entries, and delete them individually. Deleting your entire history may be more suspicious than leaving it intact with just the sensitive entries removed.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step-card">
        <h4>Use a Safe Device</h4>
        <p>If possible, use a device your abuser does not have access to: a public library computer, a friend's or family member's phone, a computer at work, or a prepaid phone purchased with cash. Many DV organizations provide safe phones to survivors. Call the hotline from a safe phone to ask about resources in your area.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step-card">
        <h4>Check for Spyware and Monitoring Apps</h4>
        <p>Common signs your phone may be monitored: battery draining unusually fast, phone running hot when not in use, unfamiliar apps installed, data usage spikes, or the abuser seeming to know things you only searched for or discussed digitally. If you suspect spyware, do not attempt to remove it (this may alert the abuser). Instead, use a different device and consult with a DV advocate about safe phone options.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step-card">
        <h4>Create a Separate, Hidden Email Account</h4>
        <p>Set up a new email address on a safe device that your abuser does not know about. Use this for cloud storage, communication with advocates and attorneys, and receiving legal documents. Choose a provider like ProtonMail or Gmail. Use a strong, unique password and enable two-factor authentication. Do not access this account on any device your abuser can reach.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 2 -->
    <h2 id="why-stealth">2. Why Stealth Recording Matters for Survivors</h2>

    <p>Domestic violence often occurs behind closed doors, with no witnesses. In court, cases frequently come down to "he said, she said" -- and historically, the system has not always believed survivors. Audio evidence changes the equation fundamentally.</p>

    <h3>What Recordings Can Prove</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Verbal threats</strong>: "If you leave, I will kill you" is a criminal threat in every US jurisdiction. A recording makes it undeniable.</li>
      <li><strong>Pattern of control</strong>: Coercive control -- constant monitoring, isolation, financial control, intimidation -- is increasingly recognized by courts as domestic abuse. Recordings can demonstrate a pattern that individual incidents cannot.</li>
      <li><strong>Contradicting the abuser's narrative</strong>: Abusers frequently present themselves as calm and reasonable in court. A recording of their actual behavior in private shatters that facade.</li>
      <li><strong>Supporting a protection order</strong>: Judges in protection order hearings weigh evidence of threats, intimidation, and danger. A recording of the abuser making threats is among the most compelling evidence available.</li>
      <li><strong>Documenting violations</strong>: If a protection order is already in place, a recording of the abuser violating it (making contact, issuing threats) provides clear evidence for enforcement.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why the Recording Must Be Stealth</h3>
    <p>An abuser who discovers they are being recorded may become violent. The discovery of a recording device or app has, in documented cases, triggered severe escalation. This is why a recording app used by a DV survivor must:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Start recording instantly -- no menus, no loading screens, no delay</li>
      <li>Display a dark or blank screen (no visible recording interface)</li>
      <li>Continue recording with the screen locked or off</li>
      <li>Not produce audible start/stop sounds</li>
      <li>Look innocuous if discovered on the phone</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout-info">
      <strong>A Note on "Provocation"</strong>
      Never deliberately provoke an abuser in order to capture a recording. This puts you at physical risk and may be used against you in legal proceedings. The purpose of recording is to capture incidents as they naturally occur -- not to manufacture them. If an incident begins and you can safely reach your phone, do so. If you cannot, do not risk escalating the situation.

    <h2 id="recording-laws">3. Recording Laws Quick Reference for DV Survivors</h2>

    <p>Recording laws vary by jurisdiction. Here is a quick reference for the countries where our readers are most concentrated. For a comprehensive breakdown of every country, see our <a href="/en/blog/recording-laws-by-country/">complete global recording laws guide</a>.</p>

    <h3>United States</h3>
    <p>The US follows <strong>one-party consent at the federal level</strong> under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (18 U.S.C. 2511). This means you can record any conversation you are part of without the other person knowing.</p>

    <p><strong>38 states + DC follow one-party consent.</strong> In these states, your recording is legal.</p>

    <p><strong>12 states require all-party consent:</strong> California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and Washington.</p>

    <div class="callout callout-success">
      <strong>Important for DV Survivors in All-Party Consent States</strong>
      Even in all-party consent states, courts frequently exercise discretion in DV cases. In protection order hearings (civil proceedings), judges often admit recordings that demonstrate threats or danger, even if they were made without the abuser's consent. The recording may technically violate wiretapping law, but judges balance this against the survivor's safety. Talk to a DV attorney about the law in your specific state before recording, but know that recordings have helped survivors in every state.
    </div>

    <h3>United Kingdom</h3>
    <p>The UK follows <strong>de facto one-party consent</strong> under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA). A party to a conversation may record it for their own use. UK courts, including employment tribunals and family courts, regularly admit recordings made by one party. In DV cases, recordings are considered highly relevant evidence in applications for non-molestation orders under the Family Law Act 1996.</p>

    <h3>Canada</h3>
    <p>Canada follows <strong>one-party consent at the federal level</strong> under Criminal Code Section 184. You may record conversations you are part of without the other person's consent. This applies in all provinces. Provincial privacy legislation may impose some restrictions on how recordings are used, but criminal law allows the recording itself.</p>

    <h3>Australia</h3>
    <p>Australia's laws vary by state. <strong>New South Wales and Queensland allow one-party consent</strong>. Victoria, Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania, and Northern Territory require all-party consent. However, most states have specific exceptions for recordings made to document criminal behavior (including assault, threats, and stalking). Consult a DV legal service in your state.</p>

    <!-- SECTION 4 -->
    <h2 id="five-steps">4. Five Steps to Safely Record and Store Evidence</h2>

    <p>Follow these steps carefully. Each step is designed to maximize your safety while creating evidence that will be useful if you decide to pursue legal action.</p>

    <div class="step-cards">
      <div class="step-card">
        <h4>Step 1: Secure Your Digital Environment</h4>
        <p>Before installing any app or creating any accounts, follow the digital safety steps in Section 1 above. Use incognito browsing. Check for monitoring software. Create a separate email account on a safe device. This foundation protects everything that follows.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step-card">
        <h4>Step 2: Install a Stealth Recording App</h4>
        <p>Download Emergency Recorder or a similar app that starts recording instantly with a single tap and does not display a visible recording interface. After installation, move the app into a folder with other everyday apps (utilities, calculators, etc.) so it does not stand out on your home screen. Test it in a safe moment to make sure you know how it works -- you do not want to be figuring out the app during a crisis.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step-card">
        <h4>Step 3: Record Safely When Incidents Occur</h4>
        <p>When an incident begins and you can safely reach your phone: open the app with a single tap, place the phone face-down on a surface or in your pocket, and let it record. The app should work with the screen off. <strong>Do not</strong> hold the phone up or do anything that indicates you are recording. <strong>Do not</strong> change your behavior to provoke a response. If it is not safe to reach your phone, do not attempt it. Your physical safety is always the priority.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step-card">
        <h4>Step 4: Upload to Secure Cloud Storage Immediately</h4>
        <p>As soon as it is safe, upload the recording to your hidden cloud storage account (the one linked to the email address your abuser does not know about). Then delete the recording from your phone if there is any chance your abuser might check your device. The cloud copy is the safe copy. If you are forced to hand over your phone, the evidence still exists beyond physical reach.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step-card">
        <h4>Step 5: Document the Context</h4>
        <p>For each recording, write a brief note (saved in your secure cloud account, not on your phone) documenting: the date and time, what happened before and during the recorded incident, any physical injuries (photograph them with timestamps), names of anyone else present, and how you were feeling. This contemporaneous documentation strengthens the recording's value as evidence.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 5 -->
    <h2 id="cloud-backup">5. Cloud Backup: Keep Evidence Beyond Physical Reach</h2>

    <p>One of the most important principles in evidence preservation for DV survivors is this: <strong>evidence must exist in a location your abuser cannot physically access, destroy, or coerce you into deleting.</strong></p>

    <h3>Why Cloud Storage Is Essential</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Phones can be seized or destroyed.</strong> An abuser who discovers recordings on your phone may destroy the device. If the recordings are only on the phone, the evidence is gone forever.</li>
      <li><strong>Abusers may force deletion.</strong> Under coercion, you may be forced to hand over your phone or unlock it. If the recordings have already been uploaded to a cloud account the abuser does not know about, the evidence survives.</li>
      <li><strong>You may need to leave suddenly.</strong> In a crisis, you may leave your home with nothing but the clothes on your back. Cloud-stored evidence travels with you to any device, anywhere.</li>
      <li><strong>Chain of custody.</strong> Cloud storage creates automatic timestamps and access logs that support the recording's authenticity if it is ever challenged in court.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Setting Up Secure Cloud Storage</h3>
    <ul class="checklist">
      <li>Create a new Google, Apple, or Dropbox account using your hidden email address</li>
      <li>Use a strong, unique password (16+ characters, not reused anywhere)</li>
      <li>Enable two-factor authentication (use an authenticator app, not SMS if possible)</li>
      <li>Do not link this account to any device your abuser has access to</li>
      <li>Access this account only through incognito/private browsing or on a safe device</li>
      <li>Consider a service like ProtonDrive for additional encryption</li>

    <h3>After Uploading</h3>
    <p>Once the recording is safely in the cloud: delete it from your phone's local storage, clear the recording app's history if possible, and clear any cloud app from your phone's "recent apps" view. The recording now exists in a location that only you (and eventually, your attorney or DV advocate) can access.</p>

    <p>Recordings are powerful, but they are even stronger when combined with other forms of documentation. DV attorneys and advocates consistently advise building a comprehensive evidence package that includes multiple types of proof.</p>

    <div class="callout callout-info">
      <strong>Tell Your Doctor the Truth</strong>
      If you visit a doctor or emergency room for injuries caused by your abuser, tell the medical provider what actually happened if it is safe to do so. Medical records that document "patient reports being struck by partner" carry significantly more weight in court than records that say "patient fell down stairs." You have the right to speak to your doctor privately, without your partner in the room.
    </div>

    <h3>Organizing Your Evidence Package</h3>
    <p>In your secure cloud storage, create a clear folder structure:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Recordings/</strong> -- Audio files, organized by date</li>
      <li><strong>Photos/</strong> -- Injury photos, property damage, organized by date</li>
      <li><strong>Messages/</strong> -- Screenshots of texts, emails, social media</li>
      <li><strong>Medical/</strong> -- Medical records, prescriptions</li>
      <li><strong>Legal/</strong> -- Police reports, protection orders, court documents</li>
      <li><strong>Journal/</strong> -- Your personal documentation of incidents</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When you are ready to consult with an attorney or DV advocate, you can share this folder securely. Having an organized evidence package dramatically strengthens your case and reduces the time and cost of legal proceedings.</p>

      <strong>Safe Calling Tips</strong>
      If you are concerned about your abuser seeing the call on your phone bill, call from a safe phone (prepaid, friend's phone, work phone). Many hotlines also offer text and online chat options that may be less detectable. If you call from your personal phone, the number will appear on your call log -- delete it afterward if your abuser checks your phone.

    <!-- FAQ -->
    <h2 id="faq">8. Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <div class="faq-section">
      <details>
        <summary>Is it legal to secretly record my abuser?</summary>
        <p>In 38 US states plus DC, you can legally record any conversation you are a party to without the other person's consent (one-party consent). In the 12 all-party consent states (California, Florida, Illinois, etc.), technically all parties must consent. However, many courts have recognized exceptions for evidence of domestic violence, and recordings are frequently admitted in protection order hearings even in all-party consent states. The UK, Canada, and New Zealand also allow one-party consent. Consult a domestic violence attorney or advocate in your jurisdiction for specific guidance.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Will a secret recording be admissible in court?</summary>
        <p>In one-party consent jurisdictions, recordings made by a participant are generally admissible in both criminal and civil proceedings. In all-party consent states, judges have significant discretion, especially in civil protection order hearings where the standard of proof is lower. Judges frequently admit recordings that demonstrate threats, violence, or danger -- even in all-party consent states -- when the recording is the best available evidence of abuse. The recording's admissibility and any criminal liability for making it are separate legal questions.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How can I record without my abuser finding out?</summary>
        <p>Use a stealth recording app that starts instantly with a single tap and displays a dark or innocuous screen. Keep the app hidden in a folder with other apps. Place your phone face-down or in your pocket during recording. After recording, upload to a cloud account your abuser does not know about and clear any recording evidence from your phone. Do not change your behavior in ways that might alert your abuser to the recording.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What other evidence should I collect besides recordings?</summary>
        <p>Build a comprehensive evidence package: photographs of injuries (with timestamps), screenshots of threatening text messages or social media posts, medical records documenting injuries, police reports, a personal diary or journal documenting incidents with dates and details, witness statements from people who observed the abuse or its effects, and financial records showing economic abuse. The more types of evidence you have from different sources, the stronger your case.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What if my abuser monitors my phone?</summary>
        <p>If you suspect your phone is being monitored, do not search for DV resources, legal help, or recording apps on that device. Use a safe alternative: a public library computer, a friend's phone, a work computer, or a prepaid phone purchased with cash. Many DV organizations can provide safe phones. Call the National DV Hotline from a safe phone to ask about resources available in your area.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Can I get a restraining order based on a recording?</summary>
        <p>Yes. Recordings of threats, verbal abuse, or violent incidents are powerful evidence in protection order hearings. Judges in civil protection order proceedings have broad discretion in admitting evidence, and the standard of proof (preponderance of the evidence) is lower than in criminal cases (beyond a reasonable doubt). A recording combined with photographs, medical records, and your testimony significantly strengthens your petition for a protection order.</p>
