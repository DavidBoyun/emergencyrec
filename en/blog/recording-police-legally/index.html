    <!-- SECTION 1 -->
    <h2 id="constitutional-right">1. Your Constitutional Right to Record Police</h2>

    <p>The right to record police officers performing their duties in public is rooted in the <strong>First Amendment</strong> to the United States Constitution, which protects freedom of speech and freedom of the press. Courts have consistently interpreted this to include the right to gather information about government officials, including law enforcement, acting in their official capacity.</p>

    <h3>Why the First Amendment Protects Recording</h3>

    <p>The logic is straightforward: the First Amendment protects not only the act of speaking or publishing but also the process of gathering information that enables speech. Without the ability to record what happens, citizens cannot meaningfully report on, discuss, or challenge police conduct. Recording is a prerequisite to the speech and press freedoms the Constitution guarantees.</p>

    <p>Key constitutional principles:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Right to gather news</strong>: The Supreme Court has recognized that freedom of the press includes the right to gather information. This applies to all citizens, not just professional journalists.</li>
      <li><strong>Government accountability</strong>: Public officials performing public duties in public spaces have a diminished expectation of privacy. Recording holds them accountable.</li>
      <li><strong>Qualified immunity limitations</strong>: Courts have increasingly held that the right to record is "clearly established," making it harder for officers to claim qualified immunity when they interfere with recording.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout-success">
      <strong>The Core Rule</strong>
      You have the right to record police officers performing their official duties in any public space. This right extends to recording with your phone, a dedicated recording device, a dashcam, or any other tool. You do not need permission from the officer, and they cannot legally order you to stop (as long as you are not physically interfering with their work).
    </div>

    <h3>What "Public Space" Means</h3>

    <p>Your right to record police is strongest in public spaces:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Streets, sidewalks, parks, and plazas</li>
      <li>Government buildings open to the public (lobbies, hearing rooms)</li>
      <li>Businesses open to the public (with the business owner's permission)</li>
      <li>Your own property (including recording through your window or from your doorstep)</li>
      <li>From inside your vehicle during a traffic stop</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The right is more limited in private spaces, though even there, recording your own interactions with police who enter your home (with or without a warrant) is generally protected.</p>

    <!-- SECTION 2 -->
    <h2 id="federal-rulings">2. Federal Court Rulings Supporting Recording Rights</h2>

    <p>Multiple federal circuit courts have issued strong opinions affirming the right to record police. Here are the most important decisions:</p>

    <h3>Glik v. Cunniffe (1st Circuit, 2011)</h3>

    <p>Simon Glik used his cell phone to record Boston police officers arresting a man on the Boston Common. Officers arrested Glik for illegal wiretapping. The First Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the charges and ruled that <strong>"the First Amendment right to gather news is, as the Supreme Court has observed, not one that inures solely to the benefit of the news media; rather, the public's right of access to information is coextensive with that of the press."</strong></p>

    <p>The court held that recording police in the discharge of their duties in a public space is a clearly established right, stripping the officers of qualified immunity.</p>

    <h3>ACLU of Illinois v. Alvarez (7th Circuit, 2012)</h3>

    <p>The Seventh Circuit struck down the Illinois eavesdropping statute as applied to recording police, holding that audio recording of police performing duties in public is protected speech under the First Amendment. The court noted that the Illinois law, which criminalized all recording without consent, was unconstitutionally overbroad.</p>

    <h3>Turner v. Driver (5th Circuit, 2017)</h3>

    <p>The Fifth Circuit explicitly recognized <strong>"a First Amendment right to record the police"</strong> and held that this right was clearly established as of 2015. The case involved a man recording a police station from a public sidewalk.</p>

    <h3>Fields v. City of Philadelphia (3rd Circuit, 2017)</h3>

    <p>The Third Circuit held that recording police activity is protected by the First Amendment, stating: <strong>"Recording police activity in public falls squarely within the First Amendment right of access to information."</strong></p>

    <h3>Irizarry v. Yehia (10th Circuit, 2023)</h3>

    <p>In a more recent decision, the Tenth Circuit affirmed the clearly established right to record police, further solidifying the consensus across federal circuits.</p>

    <div class="callout callout-info">
      <strong>Circuit Coverage</strong>
      As of 2026, the First, Third, Fifth, Seventh, Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits have all explicitly recognized the right to record police. No federal circuit has ruled against this right. While the Supreme Court has not issued a definitive ruling, it has denied certiorari in cases upholding the right, effectively allowing the circuit decisions to stand.
    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 3 -->
    <h2 id="state-variations">3. State-by-State Variations and Limits</h2>

    <p>While the First Amendment provides a federal floor of protection, state laws add complexity, particularly regarding <strong>audio recording consent requirements</strong>.</p>

    <h3>One-Party Consent States (Majority)</h3>

    <p>In most US states, only one party to a conversation needs to consent to recording. Since you are one party, you can record any conversation you are part of, including interactions with police. These states include: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming, and the District of Columbia.</p>

    <h3>Two-Party / All-Party Consent States</h3>

    <p>Approximately 11 states require all parties to consent to audio recording. However, courts in several of these states have carved out exceptions for recording police in public:</p>

      </table>
    </div>

    <div class="callout callout-warn">
      <strong>Important Nuance</strong>
      Even in all-party consent states, the prevailing legal view is that police officers performing official duties in public spaces have no reasonable expectation of privacy and therefore all-party consent laws do not apply. However, the legal landscape continues to evolve, and specific state statutes may create complications. When in doubt, record openly and state that you are recording.

    <!-- SECTION 4 -->
    <h2 id="safety-tips">4. 7 Safety Tips for Recording Police Encounters</h2>

    <p>Your legal right to record means nothing if exercising it puts you in danger. Here are seven evidence-based safety practices:</p>

    <div class="step-cards">
      <div class="step-card">
        <h4>Keep Your Hands Visible at All Times</h4>
        <p>Hold your phone where officers can see it. Do not make sudden movements to reach for your phone. If your phone is in your pocket, tell the officer what you are doing before reaching for it: "I'm going to take out my phone to record this interaction." Keeping hands visible reduces the risk of an officer perceiving a threat.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step-card">
        <h4>Maintain Physical Distance</h4>
        <p>Record from a distance that does not interfere with the officers' work. Courts have consistently held that you can be ordered to move back if you are physically obstructing police operations. A distance of 10-15 feet is generally safe for bystander recording. If you are the person being stopped, you can record from where you stand.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step-card">
        <h4>Stay Calm and Do Not Argue</h4>
        <p>If an officer challenges your recording, state calmly: "I have a First Amendment right to record police activity in public." Do not escalate, argue, or become confrontational. Your recording will speak for itself later. A calm demeanor also makes for more compelling evidence.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step-card">
        <h4>Use an App That Starts Instantly</h4>
        <p>In a police encounter, you may have seconds to start recording. Standard recording apps require multiple taps and menu navigation. Use an app designed for emergency situations that starts recording immediately upon launch. Emergency Recorder starts in under 0.5 seconds with a single tap.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step-card">
        <h4>Enable Stealth or Background Recording</h4>
        <p>In some situations, openly holding up your phone may escalate tensions. An app with stealth mode can continue recording with the screen off or while showing a different screen. This protects both you and the evidence. Remember: in one-party consent states, covert recording of your own interactions is legal.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step-card">
        <h4>Back Up Recordings Immediately</h4>
        <p>As soon as it is safe, back up your recording to a cloud service, email it to yourself, or share it with a trusted person. If your phone is seized or damaged, the backup ensures the evidence survives. Some apps offer automatic cloud backup or can livestream directly.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step-card">
        <h4>Document the Details Afterward</h4>
        <p>As soon as possible after the encounter, write down: the date, time, and location; the officers' names and badge numbers (if visible); what happened before, during, and after the recording; and the names of any witnesses. This contemporaneous account strengthens the evidentiary value of your recording.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 5 -->
    <h2 id="best-apps">5. Best Apps for Recording Police Encounters</h2>

    <p>Not all recording apps are created equal. In a high-stress police encounter, you need an app that is fast, reliable, discreet, and secure. Here are the top options:</p>

    <h3>Emergency Recorder (Recommended)</h3>

    <p>Emergency Recorder is purpose-built for situations where every second counts. It was designed with a core insight: when you are in a crisis, you cannot afford to navigate menus, wait for loading screens, or fumble with settings.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>0.5-second start</strong>: One tap launches recording immediately. No menus, no splash screen.</li>
      <li><strong>Stealth mode</strong>: Screen turns off while recording continues. The phone appears inactive to anyone watching.</li>
      <li><strong>Local storage only</strong>: All recordings stay on your device. No cloud upload, no server transmission, no third-party access.</li>
      <li><strong>Notification control</strong>: Stop recording from the notification shade without opening the app.</li>
      <li><strong>Evidence-grade metadata</strong>: Timestamps and file integrity preserved for legal use.</li>
      <li><strong>Free core features</strong>: Instant recording and stealth mode are free. Pro (one-time $4.99) unlocks unlimited storage and recording time.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout-success">
      <strong>Why We Recommend Emergency Recorder for Police Encounters</strong>
      In testing, Emergency Recorder consistently started recording faster than any other app. The stealth mode is particularly valuable during police encounters where openly holding a recording phone might escalate the situation. Local-only storage means police cannot obtain your recordings from a cloud provider without a warrant directed at you personally.
    </div>

    <h3>ACLU Mobile Justice</h3>

    <p>The ACLU offers state-specific Mobile Justice apps that allow you to record police encounters and automatically send the video to your local ACLU affiliate. Features include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Automatic upload to ACLU upon recording completion</li>
      <li>"Witness" mode to alert nearby users of an incident</li>
      <li>"Know Your Rights" information for your specific state</li>
      <li>Available for select states (not all states covered)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Limitation: Not available in all states, and the upload feature requires internet connectivity.</p>

    <h3>Standard Phone Camera/Voice Recorder</h3>

    <p>Your phone's built-in camera or voice recorder app is always available but has significant drawbacks for police encounters:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Multiple taps to launch and start recording (5-10 seconds typical)</li>
      <li>No stealth mode; bright screen visible to everyone</li>
      <li>No instant-start capability</li>
      <li>May auto-upload to cloud services (iCloud, Google Photos), creating additional access points</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Other Dedicated Apps</h3>

    <p>Several other apps offer recording features, but few combine the instant-start speed, stealth capability, and local-only storage that make Emergency Recorder ideal for police encounters. When evaluating any recording app for this purpose, prioritize:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Speed</strong>: How quickly does recording start after you tap?</li>
      <li><strong>Stealth</strong>: Can it record with the screen off?</li>
      <li><strong>Storage security</strong>: Where are recordings stored? Can they be accessed remotely?</li>
      <li><strong>Reliability</strong>: Does it work consistently without crashes?</li>
      <li><strong>Battery impact</strong>: Does it drain the battery quickly during extended recording?</li>
    </ol>

        <p>Your recording of the officer ordering you to stop is itself powerful evidence. Keep recording. Do not turn off your device. If you have stealth mode, this is the time to use it.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step-card">
        <h4>Assert Your Rights Verbally</h4>
        <p>State clearly and calmly: "Officer, I am exercising my First Amendment right to record police activity in public. I am not interfering with your duties." Say this once. You do not need to repeat it or debate.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step-card">
        <h4>Comply with Lawful Orders (Not Unlawful Ones)</h4>
        <p>If the officer tells you to step back, comply. Physical distance is reasonable. If the officer orders you to stop recording or delete footage, verbally object but do not physically resist. Say: "I do not consent to stopping my recording or deleting my files, but I will not physically resist."</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step-card">
        <h4>Note the Officer's Information</h4>
        <p>If safe to do so, note or verbally state on the recording the officer's name, badge number, patrol car number, and department. This information is critical for any subsequent complaint or legal action.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step-card">
        <h4>Do Not Physically Resist</h4>
        <p>If an officer physically takes your phone, do not resist. You can state: "I do not consent to the seizure of my phone." Resisting physically can result in arrest and injury, and undermines your legal position. The recording (if backed up) and your testimony about the seizure are your remedies.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step-card">
        <h4>File a Complaint and Contact a Lawyer</h4>
        <p>After the encounter, file a formal complaint with the police department's internal affairs division. Contact a civil rights attorney. Organizations like the ACLU, National Lawyers Guild, and local legal aid societies can help. If your phone was seized, a lawyer can seek its return and any recordings on it.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3>If Your Phone Is Seized or Recordings Deleted</h3>

    <p>Under <strong>Riley v. California (2014)</strong>, the Supreme Court held that police generally need a warrant to search a cellphone. Seizing your phone without a warrant and deleting recordings violates both the First and Fourth Amendments. If this happens:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Document everything you remember about the encounter as soon as possible.</li>
      <li>Contact a civil rights attorney immediately.</li>
      <li>File a complaint with the department and any relevant civilian oversight board.</li>
      <li>Consider contacting the ACLU or a press freedom organization.</li>
      <li>Deleted files may be recoverable through forensic analysis, which a lawyer can arrange.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout-danger">
      <strong>Never Physically Resist</strong>
      Even if an officer is clearly violating your rights by seizing your phone or ordering you to stop recording, never physically resist. Physical resistance can escalate the encounter dangerously and will be used against you in court. Assert your rights verbally, comply physically, and pursue legal remedies afterward.

    <!-- FAQ -->
    <h2 id="faq">7. Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <div class="faq-section">
      <details open>
        <summary>Is it legal to record police officers in the United States?</summary>
        <p>Yes. Every federal circuit court that has addressed the issue has ruled that the First Amendment protects the right to record police officers performing their official duties in public. The Supreme Court has also signaled support for this right. You can record police in all 50 states, though some states have specific restrictions on audio recording that you should be aware of.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Can police order me to stop recording?</summary>
        <p>Generally, no. Police cannot order you to stop recording if you are not interfering with their duties. However, they can order you to move back if you are physically obstructing their operations. If an officer orders you to stop, calmly assert your First Amendment right to record. Do not physically resist, but you can verbally object and note the officer's name and badge number.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Can police delete my recordings or confiscate my phone?</summary>
        <p>No. The Supreme Court ruled in Riley v. California (2014) that police generally need a warrant to search a cellphone. Deleting your recordings or seizing your phone without a warrant violates the Fourth Amendment. If this happens, document it and contact a civil rights attorney immediately.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Do I need to tell police I am recording?</summary>
        <p>In one-party consent states (the majority), you do not need to announce that you are recording. In two-party/all-party consent states, the law is more nuanced. Most courts have held that police officers performing duties in public have no reasonable expectation of privacy, so recording them without notification is lawful. However, to minimize confrontation, some advocates recommend calmly stating that you are recording.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What is the best app for recording police encounters?</summary>
        <p>The best app is one that starts instantly, works reliably, and keeps recordings secure. Emergency Recorder is designed specifically for high-stress situations: one tap starts recording in under 0.5 seconds, stealth mode keeps the screen off, and all files are stored locally on your device with no cloud upload. The ACLU also offers Mobile Justice apps for specific states.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Can I livestream police encounters?</summary>
        <p>Yes. Livestreaming police activity in public is protected by the First Amendment. Livestreaming has the added advantage that the footage is preserved even if your phone is seized or destroyed. However, be aware that livestreaming requires an internet connection and uses significant data.</p>
